This topic describes how to install and configure New Relic Dotnet Extension Buildpack for Pivotal 
Cloud Foundry (PCF).

You can either install the buildpacks as a tile in Ops Manager
or create them individually as separate buildpacks using <code>cf create-buildpack</code> command.


## <a id='install-opsmgr'></a> Install and Configure New Relic Dotnet Extension Buildpack for PCF in Ops Manager

To install and configure using Ops Manager, do the following:

1. Download the latest version of the tile from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/newrelic-dotnet-buildpack) or the New Relic 
GitHub [releases](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-buildpack-tile/releases).

1. To upload the product file, navigate to the **Installation Dashboard** in **Ops Manager** and click **Import a Product**.

1. To add the tile to your staging tile, click **"+"** sign. 

1. Click the **New Relic Dotnet Extension Buildpack for PCF** tile.

1. By default all 4 buildpacks are created. If you want to install the buildpacks selectively, do the following: 
    1. Navigate to **Tile Configuration** > **New Relic Buildpack Selection** and select only the buildpacks that you wish to install.
    
    1. Click **Save** on each tab.

1. Navigate to **Installation Dashboard** and click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

## <a id='install-config'></a> Install and Configure New Relic Dotnet Extension Buildpack for PCF via the cf CLI

If you do not want to install the tile, you can download the PIVOTAL file, and install and configure 
only the buildpacks you need using the cf CLI.

### <a id='install'></a> Install via the cf CLI

To install using the cf CLI, do the following:

1. Download the latest version of the tile from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/newrelic-dotnet-buildpack) or the New Relic 
GitHub [releases](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-buildpack-tile/releases).

1. To unzip the PIVOTAL file into a separate subdirectory, run the following command: 

    ```
    unzip newrelic-dotnet-buildpack-tile-VERSION-NUMBER.pivotal -d buildpack_tile
    ```

1. To change the directory to <code>buildpack&#95;tile/releases</code>, run the following command:

    ```
    cd buildpack_tile/releases
    ```
 
1. To create a new subdirectory, run the following command:
    
    ```
    mkdir SUB-DIR
    ```
    
    Where `SUB-DIR` is the name of the subdirectory you want to create. 

1. To extract the TGZ file in the releases folder into the `SUB-DIR` directory, run the following
command: 

    ```
    tar xvf newrelic-dotnet-buildpack-tile-VERSION-NUMBER.tgz -C `SUB-DIR`
    ```
    
    Where `SUB-DIR` is the name of the subdirectory you created. 
    
1. To change the directory to `SUB-DIR/package`, run the following command:
    
    ```
    cd SUB-DIR/packages
    ```

    Where `SUB-DIR` is the name of the subdirectory you created. 
    
1. To extract any of the individual buildpack TGZ files, run the following command:
    
    ```
    tar xvf BUILDPACK-NAME.tgz
    ```
    
    Where `BUILDPACK-NAME` is the name of the buildpack you want to extract.

1. To upload the zipped buildpack, run the following command:

    ```
    cf create-buildpack BUILDPACK-NAME BUILDPACK-ZIP-FILE-PATH 99
    ```

    Where:
    + `BUILDPACK-NAME` is a decriptive name for the buildpack which you are about to upload.
    + `BUILDPACK-ZIP-FILE-PATH` is the path for the zipped buildpack.


### <a id='configure'></a> Configure via the cf CLI
The buildpacks in the downloaded tile are already built and ready to be used in Cloud Foundry. 
To make changes to the buildpack or update the cached version of the buildpacks 
with a newer version of dependencies, you can build a custom copy with the cf CLI and deploy it on 
Cloud Foundry.

#### <a id='build-deploy'></a> Build the Custom Buildpack 

To build a custom copy of the buildpacks, do the following:

1. To clone the buildpack repo into your local environment, do the following:
   1. If you want to clone the New Relic Dotnet Core Extension Buildpack, run the following command:
   
          ```
          git clone https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnetcore-extension-buildpack
          ```
    
  1. If you want to clone New Relic HWC Extension Buildpack, run the following command:
   
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-hwc-extension-buildpack
        ```

1. To change the directory to the cloned buildpack, do the following:
    1. If you cloned the New Relic Dotnet Core Extension Buildpack, run the following command:
    
        ```
        cd newrelic-dotnetcore-extension-buildpack
        ```
    
    1. If you cloned the New Relic HWC Extension Buildpack, run the following command:
        
        ```
        cd newrelic-hwc-extension-buildpack
        ```

1. To source the ENVRC file, run the following command:

    ```
    source .envrc
    ```

1. To install `buildpack-packager`, run the following command:

    ```
    ./scripts/install_tools.sh
    ```

1. To build the buildpack, run the following command: 

    ```
    buildpack-packager build [ --cached ] -any-stack
    ```

<br/>
#### <a id='deploy'></a> Deploy Your Application Using the Buildpack

To deploy the custom buildpack, do the following:
 
1. To upload your buildpack, run the following command:

    ```
    cf create-buildpack BUILDPACK-NAME BUILDPACK-ZIP-FILE-PATH 99
    ```
    
    Where:
    + `BUILDPACK-NAME` is the name of the buildpack you want to upload.
    + `BUILDPACK-ZIP-FILE-PATH` is the path for the zipped buildpack.

1. To deploy your application using New Relic extension buildpacks, run the following command:

    ```
    cf push YOUR-APP -b BUILDPACK-NAME-1  -b BUILDPACK-NAME-2
    ```
    
    Where:
     + `YOUR-APP` is the name of your application.
     + `BUILDPACK-NAME-1` is one of New Relic's extension buildpacks for Dotnet Core or Dotnet Framework (HWC).
     + `BUILDPACK-NAME-2` is the name of the standard buildpack (either Dotnet Core or HWC buildpack). <br> <br>
    
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Because these are extension buildpacks,
       you must specify the main Cloud Foundry buildpack at the end of the chain.</p>
