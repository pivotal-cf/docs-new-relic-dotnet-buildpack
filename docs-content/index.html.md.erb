## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

New Relic Dotnet Extension Buildpack for PCF enables you to bind your Dotnet (Core and Framework) applications to New Relic Dotnet agents, and monitor the health and performance of these applications, analyze the data captured by agents, and aditionally correlate the captured agent data with PCF infrastructure which is collected by [New Relic Firehose Nozzle](https://network.pivotal.io/products/nr-firehose-nozzle/).

The extension buildpacks could be installed using the tile in OpsMgr, or alternatively you could extract the **".pivotal"** file, and install individual extension buildpack(s) using CF CLI command **"cf create-buildpack"** as you wish. 

Once you start monitoring your applications, you would also have the ability to set alerts based on any metrics that are collected by Dotnet agents using New Relic's alerting subsystem.


The tile installs one or more of the following 4 buildpacks depending on the tile configuration:

1. New Relic Dotnet Core Extension Buildpack for Dotnet Core Applications (Ubuntu Trusty & xenial)
1. New Relic Dotnet Core Extension Cached Buildpack for Dotnet Core Applications (Ubuntu Trusty & xenial) running in disconnected (isolated) PCF deployments
1. New Relic HWC  Extension Cached Buildpack for Dotnet Framework Applications (Windows 2012 R2 & Windows 2016)
1. New Relic HWC  Extension Buildpack for Dotnet Framework Applications (Windows 2012 R2 & Windows 2016) running in disconnected (isolated) PCF deployments

The first 2 extension buildpacks are for Dotnet Core applications running on Ubuntu Trusty (14.04) and Ubuntu Xenial (16.04). The first extension is non-cached, and the second one is cached version of buildpack for Dotnet Core.

The 3rd and 4th buildpacks are HWC extensions for Windows 2012 R2 and Windows 2016. The third extension is non-cached, and the fourth one is cached version of HWC extension buildpacks.

All 4 buildpacks use the multi-buildpack approach of Cloud Foundry and require either the standard Dotnet Core buildpack or HWC buildpack to be specified in the buildpack chain, either in application's manifest or in the CF CLI command line.
